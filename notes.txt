Our hero starts out with 100 health and rubber chicken in his hand.
Our villian is going to be a turtle that shoots ninja stars out of its mouth at random pixels within 50 pixels of the hero
Ninja stars disappear once they hit a wall on the outside of the arena.
Once the hero is hit be a ninja star, the hero loses 20 health.
In the top right corner of the arena, there is going to be a lake.

At this lake, there is going to be a tent that the turtle doesn't like. The tent is built by the hero in 3 stages.
Once the tent is built, the hero has to move to the opposite end of the arena, bottom left, to signal an army of bunnies to kill the turtle.
Once the army of bunnies is commanded, a war breaks out between the hero, bunnies, and turtle.
The bunnies throw eggs to attack the turtle and the hero's rubber chicken transforms into a double sided, blue lightsaber that reflects the turtle's ninja stars.
Once the turtle dies, the game ends and the hero and bunnies party.
